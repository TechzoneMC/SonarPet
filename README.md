SonarPet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TechzoneMC/SonarPet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TechzoneMC/SonarPet)
========
A fork of [EchoPet](https://github.com/DSH105/EchoPet) updated to modern versions

## **NOTE**: Inactive
In spite of recent activity, SonarPet is still officially unmaintained.
This is still "officially" unsupported unless I decide to 
Contact me on IRC if you're willing to help with maintenance and support.

### Supported Versions/Servers
SonarPet is undergoing some internal changes:
1. Support for "multiple versions" is being dropped.
  - Due to rapid changes to mi
  - Supporting 10 versions at once is incredibly draining!!!!
2. This plugin officially requires [Paper](https://papermc.io/)!!
  - Spigot and CraftBukkit are unsupported - they will no longer work in the future.
  - In the future, I plan to use official Paper APIs to replace most of our NMS code
  - Ideally we would have zero-NMS dependencies
3. SonarPet will be completely free, and I will no longer offer paid support.
  - SonarPet was previously released as a paid resource on Spigot 
    (with a portion of all revenue going to the old authors)
  - I apologize for dropping support for a paid plugin. I should have realized
    full-time development was incompatible with my school schedule. It was misleading,
      and I won't do it again.
    - Don't give me too hard a time: My code was still better than
      99.9% of all other paid plugins

## Features
- All mobs can be pets (even enderdragons)
- An awesome donator perk that is _EULA compliant_
- Pets are greatly customisable, through the extensive Command Base and PetMenu
- A Custom AI makes all Pets focused on specific goals, handled closely by the core of the Plugin
  - Make your pets attack your enemies

## Changes
I've made some changes to EchoPet in SonarPet, which are listed below.
- I've renamed references from 'EchoPet' to 'SonarPet'
  - Permissions and class names remain, to retain backwards compatibility and to avoid the need to change permissions
- I've added 1.9-1.11 support
  - Note: Multiple version support will be dropped in the future!!!!

## Requirements
- Modern Minecraft
 - Don't use old versions!
 - Eventually I'll drop multi-version support.....
- [Paper](https://papermc.io/)
  - Paper is strictly better than Spigot. Use it!
